# FTC-Ultimate-Goal-Ring-OpenCV
To use this code, open up your favorite python editor and just copy and paste (dont forget to update the package to make sure it matches). Hook up a camera (or use a built in one) and voila, detect all the rings you want for FTC. 

* Java version comming soon *

Detects the following:
  blue
  red
  orange (the color of the 2020 season's First Tech Challange rings)
  
Chooses which path to follow on the feild during the autonomous period.

Feel free to use it however you wish, even if it's not for FTC or robotics :)
